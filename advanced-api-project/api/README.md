## Implementing Filtering, Searching and Ordering in Django REST Framework
Document the functionality in your projectâ€™s README or code comments:

Filtering: Users can filter by title, author, and publication_year. Use the query parameters title, author, or publication_year.
Searching: Users can search the title and author fields by using the search query parameter.
Ordering: Users can sort results by title or publication_year using the ordering parameter. Use a minus sign (-) for descending order.
Example API Requests:
Filter by author: /api/books/?author=John+Doe
Search for a book: /api/books/?search=python
Order by publication year descending: /api/books/?ordering=-publication_year
