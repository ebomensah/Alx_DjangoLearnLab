Authentication System Documentation for Blog Project
1. Overview of the Authentication System
The authentication system in the Django blog project is based on Django's built-in User model and uses the default session authentication mechanism. This allows users to register, log in, log out, and manage their account details through the standard Django authentication workflow.

Features:
User Registration
User Login
User Logout
Profile Update
Email Verification
2. Authentication Flow
Step 1: User Registration
Functionality: A user can create an account by submitting a username, email, and password. The system will validate the data and create the User object.
Implementation: A form class (RegistrationForm) is used to handle user input validation and enforce rules like email uniqueness and password complexity.
View: RegisterView handles user registration logic.
Registration URL: /register/

Testing:
Go to the /register/ page.
Enter valid values for username, email, and password.
Submit the form and confirm that the user is registered, redirected to login page.
Try to register using an existing username or email to check for error handling.

Step 2: User Login
Functionality: Users log in using their username and password. If credentials match, a session is initiated, and they are redirected to their profile or the homepage.

View: LoginView processes login requests.
Login URL: /login/

Testing:
Navigate to the login page at /login/.
Provide valid credentials and confirm a successful login with a redirect to the profile/home.
Provide incorrect credentials and verify that an error message appears.

Step 3: User Logout
Functionality: Logging out will destroy the user's session and redirect them to the login page.
View: LogoutView manages the logout process.
Logout URL: /logout/

Testing:
Ensure you're logged in first.
Access the /logout/ URL.
Verify that you are logged out and redirected to the login page.

Step 4: Profile Update
Functionality: A logged-in user can update their profile details like profile_picture, email, first_name, and last_name.

View: ProfileUpdateView allows users to update their details.
Profile Update URL: /update_profile/

Testing:
Log in and visit /update_profile/.
Modify the profile_picture, email, and other personal information.
Verify the changes are saved correctly.

3. URL Endpoints for Authentication
Here are the key URLs involved in authentication:

Registration: /register/
Login: /login/
Logout: /logout/
Profile Update: /update_profile/

4. Session Management
Django uses session-based authentication. Once logged in, the session is saved in the backend, and the user’s session ID is saved in a cookie for validation on each request.

Session expiration settings in settings.py:
SESSION_COOKIE_AGE = 3600  # 1 hour
SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE = True

5. Testing Authentication Features
Test Case 1: Register a New User
Go to /register/.
Fill in a unique username, valid email, and a strong password.
Verify that the user gets successfully created and redirected to the login page.
Attempt to register again using an already-existing username or email and check for error messages.
Test Case 2: Log In
Go to /login/.
Use valid credentials and verify that the user is redirected to the profile page or homepage.
Provide incorrect credentials and verify the system shows a relevant error message.
Test Case 3: Log Out
Log in first.
Go to /logout/ and verify the user is logged out and redirected to the login page.
Test Case 4: Profile Update
Log in to the system and go to /update_profile/.
Modify profile details like email, profile_picture, and first_name.
Save the changes and ensure they are reflected immediately on the profile page.
Test Case 5: Unauthorized Access
Try to access /update_profile/ without being logged in and verify that the user is redirected to the login page.

6. Error Handling
Incorrect Login: If a user enters invalid credentials, an error message such as “Invalid username or password” will appear.
Duplicate Username/Email: When trying to register with an already existing username or email, Django will show an error, for example: “A user with that username already exists”.

7. Security Features
The default authentication system uses secure methods to protect the user data:

Password Hashing: Passwords are stored securely using PBKDF2 hashers.
CSRF Protection: All forms require a CSRF token to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
Session Handling: Django securely manages sessions and automatically handles cookie-based authentication.
Security settings can be reviewed and customized in settings.py.
