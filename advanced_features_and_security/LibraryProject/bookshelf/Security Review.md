After implementing these changes, it's important to conduct a security review to ensure:

All connections are securely encrypted via HTTPS.
Cookies are transmitted securely.
Security headers are properly configured to protect against common vulnerabilities.
SSL/TLS certificates are correctly installed and functioning.
Potential Areas for Improvement:

Regularly rotate SSL/TLS certificates to ensure they remain valid.
Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS attacks more robustly.
Consider enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your admin and user accounts.
